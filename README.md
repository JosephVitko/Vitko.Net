# Vitko.Net
This is my personal library for making ASP.NET Core web apps with Azure integration.

The library abstracts CRUD operations with Azure Blob Storage, CosmosDB, and Active Directory. It also contains some middleware and startup helpers to expedite development.

The current version supports ASP.NET Core 6.40
